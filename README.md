___This homework is due by 8am, on 01/15/15___


## Homework

1. Use the HTML provided in `index.html` and set up a new project
2. Create a `main.js` file and link it to your `index.html` file
3. Using the DOM API and the elements on the page, set up the following:

    * When I click the "calculate" button, the values in the first box shoudl be added, subtracted, multiplied or divided by the value in the second box.
    * You'll need to convert the values to a number (think `Number(value)`) in order to process them.
    * Your output should be injected into the answer element

4. Add some styles (sass) to this project and make it something pretty to look at.


## Deliverables

1. Please comment on the "Assignment 05" assigned to you with a link to this repo on Github.
2. Please push this to Github Pages and link comment a link to that URL.
3. Please close the issue.


## Go Further

* Using the same HTML, add a plus, minus, multiplication and division button.
* Instead of specifying plus, minus etc in the code, allow the user to decide it.
* This should be in the form of more buttons on the page, and when the correct button is pressed the correct action is preformed.
* Make sure the user can not put anything in the field but a number

## Go Even Further

* Remove the input fields and add buttons that look like a calculator
